- [ ] does gp work better than rf?
  -  with special uncertainty est? -- no, not today
- [X] use CB infill? no, seems to perform worse in experiments
- [X] does the surrogate model work with dependencies?
- [X] what does intermbo actually do? with RF model and with GP model
  - seems so, things just kinda suck
- [ ] what is the uncertainty of evals?
- [X] other infill crit?
- [X] multipoint proposal?
  - parallelization is difficult, we're going to work with the old system
- [X] acceleration?
  - doesn't seem to be feasible or profitable

* runs:
- mbo rf
- mbo gp
- random search
- replicates
* continuing
- [X] build sampler
- [X] check sampler works
- [X] finish bohb learner
- [X] check bohb learner works
- [X] reconstruct hb, bohb
- [ ] check these work and look as they should
- [X] write mbo for abs regret
- [X] write mbo for different & conditioned search spaces
- [X] write mbo script for different eval subsets
- [X] re-setup surrogates
- [ ] expand mbo run script for large scale
- [ ] run optimization
